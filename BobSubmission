#Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.
#Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.
#He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you yell at him.
#He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying
#anything.
#He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.
